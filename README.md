Reflection:

What did you learn about working with CSV files and pandas DataFrames in this assignment?

In this assignment, I learned how to effectively read and manipulate CSV files using pandas DataFrames. I developed skills in data loading, filtering, and basic analysis, such as calculating sums and identifying top performers. These skills are crucial for handling large datasets and can be applied to various data analysis projects, enabling me to efficiently gain insights from complex data.

What was the most challenging aspect of this assignment, and how did you overcome it?

The most challenging aspect was dealing with data integrity issues, such as incorrect column names leading to KeyErrors. To overcome this, I ensured that the correct headers were set when loading the CSV file. I also learned to verify the structure of the DataFrame using methods like df.head(), which helped me understand and correct any discrepancies early in the process.

How do you think the insights gained from analyzing ACC basketball statistics could be applied to other real-world datasets?

The insights gained from analyzing ACC basketball statistics can be applied to other domains as well. By understanding how to group data, calculate aggregates, and identify correlations, I can apply these techniques to uncover patterns and trends in different datasets. This experience prepares me for future data science challenges by providing a foundation in exploratory data analysis and visualization.
